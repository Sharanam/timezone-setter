# Timezone-setter

The timezone-setter repository provides a package that allows users to reset their system timezone in Node.js applications. This tool is particularly useful for individuals whose machines are under company policies or in multinational corporations where laptops are configured to set their timezone back to the parent location instead of the user's current living timezone. This can make it difficult for users to rely on their laptop's time for their routine work. The timezone-setter project aims to address this issue.

## Usage

To use the timezone-setter package, you can install it from npm by running the following command:

```sh
npm install timezone-setter -g
```

Run this command whenever you need to reset the timezone:

```sh
tzs
```

## Supported Operating Systems

Currently, the timezone-setter package supports Windows-based operating systems only.

**Happy timezone setting!**
