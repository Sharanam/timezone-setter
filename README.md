# TZS2

The TZS2 repository provides a package that allows users to reset their system timezone in Node.js applications. This tool is particularly useful for individuals whose machines are under company policies or in multinational corporations where laptops are configured to set their timezone back to the parent location instead of the user's current living timezone. This can make it difficult for users to rely on their laptop's time for their routine work. The TZS2 project aims to address this issue.

## Usage

To use the TZS2 package, you can install it from npm by running the following command:

```sh
npm install TZS2 -g
```

Run this command whenever you need to reset the timezone:

```sh
tzs2
```

## Supported Operating Systems

Currently, the TZS2 package supports Windows-based operating systems only.

Feel free to contribute to this project and make it even more useful for users!

**Happy timezone setting!**
